# uCount
*uCount* was born from the willingness to record daily, the number of followers of some special accounts within uTest community. These informations under certain assumptions would give an estimate of the number of uTesters. To know more about the project you can have a look at [my article at utest.com](https://www.utest.com/articles/ucount-guess-how-many-we-are).

uCount is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zlB1XxdITwGejHKXyL_yd8XCxkoCVh5RatQeaH2CJ4Q/edit?usp=sharing).
