# uCount
*uCount* was born from the willingness to record daily, the number of followers of some special accounts within uTest community. These informations under certain assumptions would give an estimate of the number of uTesters. To know more about the project you can have a look at [my article at utest.com](https://www.utest.com/articles/ucount-guess-how-many-we-are).

uCount is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zlB1XxdITwGejHKXyL_yd8XCxkoCVh5RatQeaH2CJ4Q/edit?usp=sharing).

**Starting 20/12/2018, uTest has changed the way you may look at utesters data. Now you should be logged in to be able to see other utesters stats. uCount is therefore unable to retrieve the data he was used too. I've therefore decided to stop the project.**
